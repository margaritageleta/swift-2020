> Learning Swift during COVID-19

What can be better than learning new things ... during the confinement.

## Swift basics!

When located in the `Main.storyboard` press `Command + Shift + L` to open the Library.

**Missing contraints** (red): when we do not know how to locate some object with respect to anything.
**Localization issue** (yellow): the element has no layout constraints.

To see the constraints, go to the Inspector.
To make one element relative to another element, make sure they are not overlapping!

To make a line break in a label name, press `Control + Enter`.
